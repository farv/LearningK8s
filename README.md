# Learning process for Kubernetes

In this project I should write step by step all the process I have been through until understand Kubernetes.

## Environment

For this learning process I have used a computer with Windows (yes... I know...) 10 with WSL (Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS) installed and Visual Studio Code. Everytime I said something should be installed, it should be installed in WSL. I hope this experiment works.

## Google Cloud and GKE

I have decided to create an account for Google Cloud and use its free credit. With that credit I have created a Kubernetes cluster.

Tools used for this are:

* gcloud: SDK cli

## Katacoda

I will create all Katacoda resources:

* [Launch A Single Node Cluster](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes/launch-single-node-cluster) -> This has not been performed because creating the cluster has been done with [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl?hl=es-419#generate_kubeconfig_entry)
* [Launch a multi-node cluster using Kubeadm](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes/getting-started-with-kubeadm) -> Same as above one.
* [Deploy Containers Using Kubectl](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes/kubectl-run-containers) -> TODO!!!
* [Deploy Containers Using YAML](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes/creating-kubernetes-yaml-definitions) -> TODO!!!
